**Github Practice (DS2F Group 3)**

The purpose of this branch is to enable us to practise Git commands and commits between group members.
It contains the following tasks, to be done in VS Code and Github.

**Activity 1**
1. Fork this branch to your PC.
2. Create a new folder to this branch in VS Code (Hint: Use the MK DIR set of commands).
3. Commit that folder to the main forked branch.
4. Using the "Continue your story" MD file, continue the tale and then save it.
5. Commit the new file to your forked branch on the PC and the forked branch in Github.
6. Generate a Pull Request for me to update my original branch with your new file and folder.

**Activity 2**
1. Create a new local folder on your laptop / PC.
2. Convert this new folder into a local branch and commit that branch to your Github profile (make it Public).
3. Add / Create a file in 'CodeSpace', on Github, that you wish for us to work on (like "Continue your story"). Feel free to be creative and create a Readme.md file for our instructions.
4. Paste the URL for your new branch into this chat thread on Discord.
5. The rest of us will fork it and continue working on it based on your Readme.md file.
6. We will then commit our new files from our local drive to the forked branch on Github.
7. Then we need to generate a pull request for you to update your original branch.

_The objective of these exercises are to familiarize ourselves with Github and their functions._

_If you face any errors, do paste them onto this chat thread and we will review together._

Thank you!
